# EpiKart S2 Project

A beautiful website, for a beautiful project

---

## Rules ⚠️

1.  Do not override `.gitignore` (Never add node_modules)
2.  Do not modify any `.js, .json and special files` files without asking (it could break site scripts)
3.  Mainly modify docs in `.md`

## Needed Tools

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (obviously guys)

Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Preferably use VS Code with extensions :

- [TailwindCSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [Nunjucks Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eseom.nunjucks-template)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)

you can also install the extensions that are recommended in the bottom right of VS Code

## How to use / modify

- Run a terminal from : Terminal -> New Terminal, in VS Code (in the git folder)
- To install all Node Packages : `npm i concurrently @11ty/eleventy tailwindcss @tailwindcss/typography` (in the git folder)
- To run a server (locally) to test your modification :
  - Run `npm run start` (in the git folder)
  - Go in your browser an type URL which is described as Local, usually `localhost:8080`
- Do your modification / experimentation
- Git publish (to update the git for TEAM BINBINKS, but also for the live site render)
  - Add your files, if needed (Don't forget rule 1)
  - Commit with an explicit message (no laziness will be allowed)
  - Don't forget to push
